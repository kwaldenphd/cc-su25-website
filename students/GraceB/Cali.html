  <h1>Cali</h1>
  <p>This is Cali! She is a border collie and she loves playing with her toys and going for long walks. If you throw her toy one singular time you have a new friend for life, but be prepared because she'll bring her toy back again and again until your arm falls off. Cali is definitely a rule-follower and also wants all the other dogs to follow the rules as well. She is the alpha dog in our little pack of sorts. If she sees another dog not following the rules, she'll step in and let them know. Cali is also very intelligent and understands far more words than the average dog. She also love running and playing with her toys on the beach. She loves when someone finds a slightly buried item and she must dig it out and find out what it is. Cali is so loving and always wants everyone to be together. This likely stems from any amount of herding instincts she has. Whenever we go for walks, she tries to make everyone walk close together, which usually ends up with someone (Me) tripping on someone's foot.
