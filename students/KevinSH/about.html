          <h2>Kevin Sanchez-Hernandez - Founder</h2>
          <p>
            Kevin Sanchez-Hernandez is an emerging leader with a global vision and a deep commitment to internaitonal affairs.
            Currently completing his Bachelors of Arts in Spanish at the University of Notre Dame, Kevin plans to continue his academic journey 
            by pursuing a law degree with a specialization in international law.
          </p>
          <p>
            His academic pursuits reflect a larger mission: to build meaningful, cross-cultural connections through language, law, and service.
            Fluent in both English and Spanish, and conversational in Italian and Russian, Kevin believes that 
            <em>"the greatest respect you can give to a different culture is to learn their language."</em>
            This guiding principle fuels his passion to bridge communities and foster genuine, human-centered service in international business settings. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Raised in Chicago, Illinois, and shaped by his roots as the son of immigrants from Guerrero, Mexico, Kevin has firsthand experience navigating 
            and adapting across cultural landscpaes. His background has instilled in him a strong sense of empathy, adaptability, and dedication to inclusivity: 
            values that underpin his professional approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kevin's drive is to expand his services with authenticity and integrity, offering a personalized and culturally aware experience that prioritzes 
            human connection. His leadership is inspired by a more connected world: one where language and cultural understanding are the foundation 
            for trust and collaboration.
