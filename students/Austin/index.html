<body>    <h1>Austin's Senior Year Website</h1>
    <p>My name is Austin Harjo, and this is a website documenting my senior year at the University of Notre Dame.</p>

    <h1>Get to Know Me</h1>
    <p>I am 21 years old, and am double majoring in Marketing and American Studies at the University of Notre Dame. I grew up in Wichita, Kansas, but my family moved to Tahlequah, Oklahoma after I graduated High School. Growing up playing baseball in Kansas, I became a huge <a href=”https://www.mlb.com/royals”>Kansas City Royals</a> and <a href=”https://www.chiefs.com/”>Kansas City Chiefs</a> Fan!
    <h1>Senior Summer</h1>
    <p>My Senior Year started a bit early, as I am living in my senior year house in South Bend, and taking two online summer courses. Aside from my course work, this summer I am working for the Notre Dame Football Team in the Video Ops department, working for DoorDash as a Summer Sales Development Representative, and and trying to enjoy an active lifestyle by going to the gym and golfing multiple times a week.</p>
