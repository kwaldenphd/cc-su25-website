  <h1>The Vibrant Roman Food Scene</h1>
  <p>When you think of pizza, chances are the first image that pops into your mind is something like Rocco's Pizza, a wonderful establishment with excellent pies. The pizzas are usually gigantic: 18 inches or something like that. They're meant to be shared. The crust is usually floppy because of the sheer volume of cheese and toppings. Americans love "Meat Lovers Pizza," where you'll find pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon, and maybe even meatball chunks. It's meaty. It's intense. It's consummately American.</p>
  <p>Rome and Italy as a whole are quite different. The popular Roman pizza is called "pizza a taglio," literally pizza by the cut. You'll find yourself in a small shop with a sweet Italian woman wielding a scissor in one hand and a spatula in the other. There's a vast selection of different pizzas and toppings, from zucchini slices to potato and hotdogs to your prosciutto and mozzarella slices. The pizzas are long and rectangular, crusty and crispy, hot and fresh. The sweet Italian woman will cut up the slices to your desired amount, and you simply pay by the weight. The pizza gets warmed up in the oven, and within five minutes, you have a wonderful lunch or snack presented humbly on a paper plate. You stand outside or sit on a high chair and just chow down. Buon Appetito!</p>
  <p>There is, of course, more than just pizza a taglio. The popular street food here is called supply, which is like the cousin to the Sicilian arancini. It's a ball of risotto, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese that is fried to perfection. There is the classic Neapolitan pizza: the circular ones with puffy, charred crusts. Rome has four classic pasta dishes: carbonara, cacio e pepe, amatriciana, and gricio. If we're being completely honest, carbonara is the best. It is quite elite.</p>
 <p>I could go on forever about the food scene here, but I'll summarize my findings in a brief table with entirely subjective ratings. And I'll provide some great pictures!</p>
