  <h1>Who's Jonah?</h1>
  <p>At Notre Dame, I study finance and Classics. Usually, when I tell people this, there is a visible reaction. Sometimes, people furrow their eyebrows and purse their lips in confusion: why would I be spend my nights in Hesburgh Library grinding out spreadsheets and also reading Latin and Greek writings. Then, I do my rehearsed lines for why I study what I study.</p>
  <p>Other times, people will just nod their head (regretting they asked the question) and then ask what Classics is. They know what finance is: it's spreadsheets, money, investing, greed, white collar crime, Jordan Belfort, Mendoza. But Classics often elicits an explanation.</p>
  <p> For the purpose of this website, Classics is the reason why I am here in Rome. Classics is the one-pop-shop for language, culture, archaeology, literature, and history for classical cultures, that is, Latin and Greek. This past spring semester, I studied at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies, along with 32 other American undergraduate classical studies students to fully immerse ourselves in the ancient city. All the classes we took were site visits out in the city or even outside Rome. I have been spelunked into ancient caves, held 2000+ year old artifacts, and dispelled most of the misconceptions about Ancient Rome.</p>
  <p>For majority of this summer, I am living here in Rome, working at the Pontifical Gregorian University, a Jesuit university in the heart of the city. For some context, it opened up in the mid 16th century. It is the proud alma mater of Pope Leo XIII, the Pope famous for essentially creating Catholic Social Teaching. I work in the Archives of the University, working on transcribing and translating Latin manuscripts from the 17th century.</p>
