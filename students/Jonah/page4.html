  <h1>The Eternal City: Old and New</h1>
  <p>One of my professors once described Rome very aptly: she called it a "palimpsest." This is a technical term for a manuscript that has been written on, over and over again, often with the next author erasing the previous text to put new text. The urban landscape has changed so very much for Rome's 2700+ year life, but there are gems scattered throughout the city that have been well preserved over time. This is to say, Rome is more than the Pantheon and the Colosseum, which are undoubtedly the most popular destinations. Sometimes these sites deserve the hype, other times they don't (looking at you, Colosseum).</p>

  <p>I will share two sites that have a special place in my heart. First is the Theatre of Marcellus, which was constructed in 17 BC by the first emperor Augustus Caesar in commemoration for his nephew Marcellus. It is by a major thoroughfare in Rome, but it doesn't get the same love as the Colosseum, even though I think this one is so much cooler. The theatre was first used as a place for theatrical performances and musical contests, but its use has changed so much over time (remember the palimpsest). In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was used as a fortress for noble families. Its arcades housed the shops of merchants and vendors all the way into the early 20th century. Now, there is are private apartments above it! So, you can live above the ruins of a theatre that is over 2000 years old. Incredible stuff. But, the reason why it is special to me is because it was the site that I gave an oral presentation about for a class. It was a time for me to share my love of imperial Roman history with others, to completely nerd out, as it were. It was a moment that I actually got to make my education my own, to take initiative to pursue something academically that I was very interested in. It is my favorite site in Rome for a good reason.</p>

  <p>The next site is the Roman Forum--classic. Once again, the palimpsest analogy shines its brightest. The Roman Forum is the quintessential icon and symbol of Roman life and history. From its use as a burial ground in the 8th century BC to the hub of political and religious life in Rome to a cow pasture in the 18th century, the Roman Forum has held many different appearances. When I first visited it, I kept having to pinch myself because I couldn't believe that I was actually seeing the place that I had spent years reading and learning about. Now, I actually get to see it. To walk around. To take pictures of it. To actively participate in the rich, dynamic history of the space. I come here frequently just to amble and wander around; I could spend days here and still find new cool things. Words can scarcely describe how awesome the Roman Forum is.</p>
