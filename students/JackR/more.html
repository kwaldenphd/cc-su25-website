<h1>Fashion Vs Style</h1>

<p>The difference between style and fashion comes down to individual expression vs. collective trends: Fashion is what’s popular at a given time.
It’s about current trends, what designers, brands, and culture say is “in.” Fashion changes constantly from season to season. Style is personal. It’s how you choose to dress, express yourself, and put outfits together, regardless of what’s trending. 
Style is more consistent and reflects your personality, values, and creativity.</p>

<p>Fashion is what you buy. Style is what you do with it.</p>
